# SCADA-Studio5000

This repository brings together **Ladder (Studio 5000) files** developed for different challenges in **automation and industrial control**.  
Each challenge includes its corresponding **simulation in Factory I/O**, and in some cases, integration with **Ignition** and **Node-RED**, showcasing applications of **PLC, SCADA, and IoT**.  

Each implementation is also accompanied by a **YouTube video** explaining its operation and the applied logic.
